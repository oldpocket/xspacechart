# This is a sample, individual ~/.spacechartrc file.  It is designed
# to work with a system-wide /usr/local/src/spacechart/spacechartrc
# file. `spacechart' loads this file after the system-wide file.

# Please note that the spacechart program separates the selection of
# what is shown from the way in which it is drawn.
# Consequently, for example, link_rules must always possess a default
# to handle all links not otherwise covered.
# In short, you must specify how to draw everything, and then
# select a portion to display.

################

# As of 2001 Dec 16, this RC file is set to show G and K stars in
# single systems only.  It does not show any multiple star systems.

# Only stars with a maximum luminosity of less than 10 times Sol are shown.
# This excludes red giants.

# Links are set to 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 light years.
# The maximum link is 18 light years.

# Also, this RC file is set to a view_radius of 40 ly, since this size
# shows the group of close stars between Beta Canum Venaticorum and
# Lambda Serpentis, including beta Coma Berenices and Eta Bootis.
# Otherwise, 30 ly is a good choice of radius.

################

#### Select default source of data.
catalog = "/usr/local/share/spacechart/gliese.dat"

#### Select default distance unit.
# Possible values are pc (parsecs) and ly (light years)
distance_unit = ly

#### Select default radius of the visible sphere,
# in either pc (parsec) or ly (light year)
# Format:  view_radius = distance distance_unit
# A view_radius of 40 ly is OK if you display only single G and K stars
# Your diplay may be cluttered if you show more stars; in that case,
# choose a smaller view_radius, such as 20 ly or 30 ly
view_radius = 40 ly

#### Select default center for coordinates.
# user_coords use degrees of latitude and longitude,
# expressed in that order.  They are based on Equatorial Coordinates.
# Longitude increases counter-clockwise with respect to Sol.
# Format:  user_coords = (latitude, longitude)
user_coords = (0,0)


# star_rules      specifies how stars are shown
# star_selection  specifies which stars are shown

#### Select default rules that specify how stars are drawn.
# First, the color to use for each spectral type.
# Order matters!! 'W' means any white dwarf.
# (The following expression must appear to the program
# as if it is on one single line; either escape
# carriage returns with a backslash or comment out the line.)
star_rules = ( ( O : (R: 1.0 ; G: 1.0 ; B: 1.0 );      \

    # between 0.001 and 1000 times Sol, and all types of star.
               ( 0.001; 1000 ; [OBAFGKMW]; true ) )

#### Select which stars are shown by default
#  Format is:
#    star_selection = ( min_lum; max_lum; set_of_classes; show_multiples )
#     min_lum the minimum luminosity you want, empty to indicate no limit.
#     max_lum the maximum luminosity you want, empty to indicate no limit.
#     set_of_classes is a square bracket enclosed list of spectral classes
#       you want to be shown. Empty means no stars are shown.
#     show_multiples is either true or false.
#
# The following shows stars that are less then 10 times the
# luminosity of our sun.  This prevents red giants from being shown.
# Also, only G and K stars will be shown.
# In addition, only stellar systems with one star are shown.
# No multi-star systems such as Alpha Centuri will be shown.
star_selection = (;10;[GK];false)

#### Select the default maximum length of a link to be shown on the map
# in pc (parsec) or ly (light year)
# Note that all link_rules must have a default for showing longer links
# but only links that are shorter than this length will be shown.
# Format:  max_link = distance distance_unit
max_link = 18 ly

#### Select how to show links, regardless of length
# Note that link rule must have a default or `other'
# rule that specifies how  all longer links are shown,
# if they are selected.
# (By default in this ~/.spacechartrc file, this default or
# `other' rule is not used; but during operation, you may change
# the value of max_link.)

# A link_rules expression must be a single line;
# if you want to see it on several lines, as below,
# escape each carriage return with a backslash.
# (You do not need to escape lines that are commented out;
# but are commented out here because they look better.)

# The following shows links of 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 ly
