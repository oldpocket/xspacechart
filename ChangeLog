	the label settings.

	* src/settings.c (handle_callbacks): Moved the clearing of the changed
	settings inside the if(cb_enabled). Stupid bug.

	* src/config_dialog.c: Created dummy version.

	* src/gui.c (gui_new): Added support for the config dialog.

	* src/gui.c: Added the distance unit selection frame.

	* src/settings.c (handle_callbacks): Fixed the function to avoid a 
	potentially infinite recursion. See comment to the function for 
	details.

	* Renamed the project as 'spacechart', designed arbitrary version num-
	ber as 0.8 and deleted old ChangeLog.
