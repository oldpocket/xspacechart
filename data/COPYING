LEGAL STATUS OF DATA FILES
--------------------------
Miguel Coca, <mcoca@gnu.org>

This text is an explanation of the exact legal status of the files in this
directory. If you are not interested in that kind of thing, just rest
assured that I've taken every measure I could to make sure it is perfectly
legal to distribute the contents of this directory.

The following files:

	bayer_flamsteed_names
	proper_names
	read_ccdm.pl
	combine_star_data.pl
	gen_spacechart.pl

Were written/assembled by me as part of my work on GNU SpaceChart, and are
therefore copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation and distributed under
the terms of the GNU General Public License.

However, the other data files in this directory, generated by the programs
above, are derived from astronomical catalogues owned by their authors. The
catalogues used were the Hipparcos main catalogue and the CCDM.

I emailed the owner of each catalogue the following set of questions:

	First, I would like to know if I'm allowed to redistribute the data
	at all. Although I won't charge money for the program, it is likely
	that it will be included in "collections" of software that are sold.

	Next, since the entire catalogue is way too large for me to include
	it in my package, I would most likely include just a subset of it.
	By subset I mean that I wouldn't include all stars, nor all the data
	for each star (in practice, I would just make a new catalogue based
	on your data). Would that be allowed?

	The last question is about usage retrictions. At some sites, I've
	found that data catalogues are distributed "for scientific usage".
	Usually they fail to define "scientific usage". Is there such a
	restriction on the data? If there is what is your definition of
	scientific usage?

	I mean, obviously SpaceChart is a scientific tool (whether it is
	really useful for scientists is another matter), but what if someone
	adapts it for use in a game? Would they still be allowed to use the
	data?

I reproduce the replies from each one:

* Hipparcos Catalogue

	ESA wishes to encourage the use and visibility of its results.
	I can confirm that you are essentially free to make use of the
	Hipparcos data as you wish (for example, as you have described).

	What ESA is does expect, as you have noted, is a suitable  
	(and suitably prominent) message acknowledging ESA and the
	Hipparcos mission. The details are left to your discretion.

	Good luck

	regards

	Michael Perryman
	Project Scientist, Hipparcos

* CCDM

		Dear Sir,
	        I have no objection concerning the use of the CCDM
	catalogue. But this catalogue has been deposited at the CDS at
	Strasbourg. So I think that it would be wise for you to ask Fran?ois
	OCHSENBEIN of this institution for the same permission. His address is
                	fran?ois@vizir.u-strasbg.fr
        	Good luck.
                                                J.Dommanget

As of November 24th, 2002, I have received no official statemente from Mr.
Ochsenbein. However, in his reply to my questions he wrote:

	"My first reaction would be to agree with any usage in the same
terms as the GNU license, extended to the data (in addition to the software
terms) with proper quotations and the data (authors, and version) -- but
I'll have to check a bit more carefully."

So, I assume I will be given permission eventually, and I'm preparing the
release accordingly.
