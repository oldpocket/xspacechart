Changes in version 2.0.0
------------------------
	
	* Removed autoconf tool and files
	
	* Refactory to XForms, replacing GTK1.x

Changes in version 0.9.5
------------------------

	* SpaceChart is now part of the GNU Project.

	* Added bulgarian translation.

	* Added french translation.

	* Added saving configuration files.

	* SpaceChart now uses Right Ascension instead of longitude when
	interacting with users.

	* You can now see a list of all stars in the current dialog, and
	center the map on any of them.

	* The default data file now comes from Hipparcos/CCDM. Read 
	data/README to find out more.

Changes in version 0.9.4
------------------------

	* IMPORTANT: Syntax of the config file has changed. Please replace
	your system-wide spacechartrc (/usr/local/etc/spacechartrc in most
	cases) with the provided spacechartrc file.

	* Now a single ~/.spacechartrc is read as configuration file.

	* Plenty of bugfixes to config files.

	* Added button to reset the map to the default settings.

	* Fixed even more bugs.

Changes in version 0.9.3
------------------------

	* Config files. On startup all files in the ~.spacechart/ directory
	are read as configuration files.

	* Customizable keybindings. Now most actions available through menu
	and/or mouse can have an associated keyboard key.

	* Reduced default window size to avoid problems with low resolution
	screens.

	* The Right Ascension/Declination of the selected star is available
	in the star info dialog.

	* About data file dialog, which shows info about the data file
	currently loaded into memory.

	* Older data files are now incompatible. I don't know of any other
	than the one distributed with spacechart, so I don't think there will
	be problems.

	* General bugfixes.

Changes in version 0.9.2
------------------------

	* Added a button to the star configuration page to select which stars
	have their name drawn.

	* Added menu items for most toobar actions.

	* The gliese.dat file has been modified, so that most stars now have
	a name that can be displayed on the map.

	* Clicking on stars should be easier now, since the sensitive area
	around them has been increased.

	* Added an option to abort a file load in progress.

	* Now the user coordinates are shown.
