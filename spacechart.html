<H3><A name="intro">Introduction</A></H3>

Have you ever wanted to see how the stars are distributed in space? <P>

Do you want to know how far Tau Ceti is from Alpha Centauri? <P>

Or how many stars are there within 10 light years of the Sun? <P>

Then this program is for you. <P>

GNU SpaceChart is a program that allows you to see the stars in glorious 3D and
rotate them to see them from any point of view. You can also limit which stars
you want to see, according to their spectral class and luminosity, and draw
links between all stars closer than a certain distance. <P>

GNU SpaceChart works under the <A href="http://www.gnome.org/"> GNOME </A> 
environment. Provided GNOME is present, it's known to work on GNU/Linux,
FreeBSD and Solaris 8. If you get it running on other systems, please tell
me.<P>

<LI><P><B>(2002-12-09)</B> Larger Hipparcos data sets are available. You can
download from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> two extra data
files for GNU SpaceChart. The files are:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI><A href=
    "http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/spacechart/hip60.dat.bz2">
    hip60.dat.bz2</A>: All stars in the Hipparcos catalogue within 60 parsecs
    (over 190 light years) of the Sun. This reaches all the way to the
    Hyades, which are easily recognizable if you look for them, and then
    some more. I recommend that most people use this data file, but didn't
    include it in the main distribution because of it's size.
    </LI>
    <LI><A href=
    "http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/spacechart/hip120.dat.bz2">
    hip120.dat.bz2</A>: Same thing, but with a 120 parsecs radius. This is
    actually a bit too much for most people, but it shows what can be done
    with the Hipparcos data.
  </UL>
<P>To use the files, just run bunzip2 on them and copy them to your data
directory (usually /usr/local/share/spacechart/).
</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>(2002-12-06)</B> <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/spacechart/spacechart-0.9.5.tar.gz">GNU SpaceChart 0.9.5</a> Released! While I the last official
atuthorization has not arrived, I've been unofficial assured that there is no
problem with my publishing the catalogue data. As I already have official
permission from the people with the clearest rights over the data (it's
authors), I've decided to go ahead with the release. You can see the details
of this story in the file data/COPYING.<P>

<P> Anyway, the new release is here with quite a few new features. Now you
can save your configuration automatically, so you can find that great
position and save it without bothering to edit the config file.</P>

<P>For people who want to stay true to the scientific nomenclature, GNU
SpaceChart now uses Right Ascension instead of Longitude. Also, you can
browse a list of all the stars in the currently loaded catalogue and center
the map on any of them.
</P>

<P> But one of the most important new features in the new release is the new
data file. It's been build using the astrometric data from the Hipparcos
Mission, complemented with data about multiple stars from the CCDM. While
the default data file included with SpaceChart covers only stars within 30
parsecs of the Sun, I'll upload some larger files to the sourceforge project
page.
</P>

<P>I hope you enjoy GNU SpaceChart!
</P>
</LI>

<LI><P><B>(2002-11-20)</B> Whatever you've heard, no I'm not dead :-) Nor is
SpaceChart, by the way. The new release has been ready in CVS for some time
now (the last important change happened back in July), and only been held by
legal problems with catalogues.</P>

<P>It turns out that, at least in Europe, astronomical catalogues are
protected by IP laws (particularly the EU database directive). This has led
me into a long exchange of emails with the authors and owners of the data I
wanted to use.</P>

<P>At the moment I'm waiting for what hopefully will be the last
authorization needed. As soon as I have that, I'll make the release. At this
rate, it may yet happen on the first days of December, for the third year in
a row :-)</P>

<P>The good thing about these legal problems is that I've been forced to
move to the Hipparcos data (the problem with the Gliese data is that nobody
really knows who is the owner, so there is noone to ask for permission to
use it). So, at the expense of some resolution in the close proximity of the
Sun (mostly red dwarfs), we'll have data files that reach all the way to the
Hyades!</P>

<P>I'll be uploading the scripts for generating these data files to CVS over
the next few days (as I polish them a bit), and will upload the files
themselves when I get the official permission.</P>

<P>So, I assure you that the wait will be worth it :-)</P>
</LI>

<LI><B>(2002-05-06)</B> Today SpaceChart has become part of the GNU project!
We will soon move the web page over to gnu.org, although the CVS repository (and a mirror
of the web page) will remain at sourceforge, for a time at least. A new release should come
soon after that.</LI>

<LI><B>(2001-12-24)</B> <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/spacechart/spacechart-0.9.4.tar.gz">SpaceChart 0.9.4</a> Released. 
This release fixes many problems with configuration files. Now only one file 
is used (<TT>~/.spacechartrc</TT>), and the format has changed slightly. Also, 
a button to reset the program to it's initial settings has been added.</LI>

<LI><B>(2001-12-5)</B> <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/spacechart/spacechart-0.9.3.tar.gz">SpaceChart 0.9.3</a> Released. 
After almost a year's work (Well, mostly in other things, but SpaceChart never 
stopped being developed), a new version is out. <P>

The most important new feature in this release is configuration files, which
can be read by the program at startup, and in which you can define most of
the program parameters. Also, most actions now have keyboards equivalents
(customizable via config files). Several bugs were fixed (and probably
countless new ones were introduced), and a few minor features were added.
For more details check the NEWS and README files. <P>

Also, another version of the data_gliese package has been released, since
data files from previous versions are incompatible with 0.9.3.

<LI><B>(2001-12-4)</B> SpaceChart moves to Sourceforge.</LI>

<LI><B>(2000-12-21)</B> <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/spacechart/spacechart-0.9.2.tar.gz">SpaceChart 0.9.2</a> Released. Important changes in this
release include the display of the user coordinates, the ability to select
which stars have their name attached on the map, and various user interface
improvements</LI>

<LI><B>(2000-12-21)</B> Version 1.1 of the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/spacechart/data_gliese-1.1.tar.gz">data_gliese</a>
package has been released</LI> 

<LI><B>(2000-12-14)</B> Released Web Page.</LI>

astronomical catalogues.</A> The Gliese catalogue is number V/70A. Other
catalogues that are useful for building data files are the Yale Bright Star
Catalogue (V/50) and the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues (I/239) (I intend
to build files from the Hipparcos data in the future). </LI>
